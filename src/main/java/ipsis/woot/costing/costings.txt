The end result of the costing, is a number of units required to run the factory.
And that results in a total number of units and a total number of ticks.


TIER_UNITS_PER_TICK = base unit cost per tick to operate the factory
RAW_SPAWN_TICKS = number of ticks to spawn the specific mob IGNORING the rate upgrade
MOB_HEALTH = number of health points for the mob
UNITS_PER_HEALTH = number of units for each health point
NUM_MOBS = number of that are spawned INCLUDING the mass upgrade


BASE_FACTORY_COST = RAW_SPAWN_TICKS * TIER_UNITS_PER_TICK
RAW_MOB_COST = RAW_SPAWN_TICKS * (MOB_HEALTH * UNITS_PER_HEALTH)

for each upgrade
    UPGRADE_COST = RAW_SPAWN_TICKS * UPGRADE_UNITS_PER_TICK

By default each mob costs the same as the last one so the cost scales linearly with number of mobs.
The option will be here to scale that differently, where each subsequent mob gets more expensive.
However this can really ramp up the costs.

FINAL_SPAWN_TICK = number of ticks to spawn the specific mode INCLUDING the rate upgrade

Efficiency is applied last and is used to reduce the total unit cost
