      "text": "There are many interesting ways to perform this operation, the main drawback is that there are lots of entities generated and when scaled up on a server can impact performance. Woot gives you a mob farm/factory without generating all those messy entities and hopefully takes a bit of load off your server. It is also for lazy people like me that don't like building mob farms."
